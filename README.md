# Master Unit List C-bill/BV Analysis

This repository contains a copy of unit information from the Master Unit List.
This information comes from [Free Worlds Tech](https://github.com/free-worlds-tech/mul-archive).

The `json_to_csv.ipybn` converts from JSON files from the Free Worlds Tech repo to a CSV, `units.csv`.
This CSV was manually updated with information from [MegaMekLab](https://github.com/MegaMek/megamek) to fill in missing BV and C-bill values.

The `csv_to_plots.ipybn` file does analysis on the C-bill/BV ratio, binning by weight class and BattleMech vs OmniMechs.

This repo uses an unofficial, fan-maintained copy of data published by Catalyst Game Labs.
